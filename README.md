# Yet Another MuJoCo Tutorial

Our beloved [MuJoCo](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco) has depricated the previous [MuJoCo Python bindings](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/README.md). However, thanks to generous [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/), MuJoCo is now open and free to the public and it seems like a good timing to make a tutorial for this. 

One of the greatest adavantages of using MuJoCo is that we can simply install with CLI:
```
pip install mujoco
```
